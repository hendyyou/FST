2007-05-19 : JPF 1.5.1
+ Maven POM files are now part of the JPF distribution package. Thanks to
  Jens KÃ¶cke for contribution.
+ Changed plug-in DTD to allow arrange of <extension> and <extension-point> tags
  in mixed order.

  order to automate build process using tasks like <subant>.
+ Added German translation of resources. Thanks to Stefan Rado for contribution.
+ Significant improvements in classloader performance. See new configuration
  options in org.java.plugin.standard.StandardPluginLifecycleHandler class. New
  performance optimizations are ON by default.
